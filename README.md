###Installation Guide
Things that need to be installed to test the current app.
1.) python pip stuff
2.) node_modules in React_frontend

so go added that pls

###Set up Flask server
First, navigate to the folder called Flask_backend

```sh
$ cd Flask_backend
```

Optional: It is a good idea to create a python virtual environment so that it dosen't hurt ur computer boyz

```sh
$ python3 -m venv env
```

To run the venv, use command: pipenv shell

```sh
$ pipenv shell
```

Then installed all the python model for the application

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start the server, just use command: flask run

```sh
$ flask run
```

###Set up React page
navigate to the react folder then install the node module and run: npm start

```sh
$ cd React_frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Now the current application should work? I guess?
